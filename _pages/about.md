## Summary

My research is broadly in applied mathematics, scientific computing, and fluid dynamics. I study and develop mathematical models, numerical algorithms, and open-source software for applications involving fluid flows, granular-fluid mechanics, and wave propagation. My research focus involves PDEs (particularly hyperbolic systems), finite volume numerical methods, well-balanced methods, and adaptive mesh refinement techniques. I currently investigate shallow earth-surface flows with varying granular and fluid compositions. Examples include tsunamis, overland flooding, sediment-laden flows, and dense granular-fluid flows such as landslides and debris flows.
