## Summary

My research is broadly in applied mathematics and scientific computing. I study and develop mathematical models, numerical algorithms, and open-source software for applications in computational geophysics. My mathematical focus involves PDEs (particularly hyperbolic systems), finite volume numerical methods, and adaptive mesh refinement techniques. I study problems in geophysics involving wave propagation and flows, particularly shallow earth-surface flows with varying granular and fluid compositions. Examples include tsunamis, overland flooding, sediment-laden flows, and dense granular-fluid flows such as landslides and debris flows.
