## Software developement

#### Clawpack

Clawpack is a collaboratively developed software package for solving general hyperbolic conservation laws, and related PDEs, utilizing adaptive finite-volume wave-propagation algorithms. See the Clawpack site ([clawpack.org](http://www.clawpack.org)) for an overview, source-code repositories, documentation, and other information for developers and users. The Clawpack repositories can be accessed directly on github ([github.com/clawpack](https://github.com/clawpack)).


#### GeoClaw

GeoClaw is software for simulating shallow, earth-surface flows involving water wave-propagation and/or inundation (*eg.*, tsunamis and general overland flooding problems) GeoClaw is a subset of, and included with, Clawpack --- additional info is available at Clawpack's GeoClaw site ([geoclaw.org](http://www.geoclaw.org)). 

The GeoClaw code included with Clawpack has the latest enhancements of the current Clawpack code (v5). 

#### D-Claw

D-Claw is a generalization of GeoClaw for solving two-phase flows (granular-fluid mixtures), including landslides, debris flows, and lahars. D-Claw can also be used for simulating hybrid problems that involve the interaction of granular-fluid flows with bodies of water (*eg.*, landslide-generated tsunamis, dam breach floods, fluid or solid entrainment by inundating flows).

The documentation available with Clawpack (v5) and GeoClaw provides a good general overview, however, D-Claw is built on, or extended from, older versions of Clawpack and GeoClaw (v4.x). The older v4.x version of Clawpack is available at [github.com/clawpack/clawpack-4.x](https://github.com/clawpack/clawpack4.x). See [clawpack.org](http://www.clawpack.org) for more information. Running D-Claw requires additional set-up parameters. Documentation for D-Claw is currently unsatisfactory, but in progress.

The source code and latest git repository for D-Claw are available on github:

* [github.com/geoflows/D-Claw](https://github.com/geoflows/D-Claw).

A repository for applications is also available:

* [github.com/geoflows/dclaw-apps](https://github.com/geoflows/dclaw-apps).

The application repository is in progress, as is documentation for D-Claw. If you would like to make contributions to either of these repositories, please follow the development workflow used for Clawpack, described at [http://www.clawpack.org/developers.html](http://www.clawpack.org/developers.html). Briefly, please fork the repositories to your own github account, and issue pull requests on a feature branch to github/geoflows.

Licenses and use of D-Claw inherit the Clawpack licenses.
