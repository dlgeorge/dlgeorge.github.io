## Software developement

#### Clawpack

Clawpack is a collaboratively developed software package for solving general hyperbolic conservation laws, and related PDEs, utilizing adaptive finite-volume wave-propagation algorithms. See the [Clawpack](http://www.clawpack.org) site for an overview, downloads, code repositories, documentation, and other information for developers and users.

#### GeoClaw

GeoClaw is software for simulating shallow, earth-surface flows involving water wave-propagation and/or inundation (*eg.*, tsunamis and general overland flooding problems) GeoClaw is a subset of Clawpack --- additional info is available at Clawpack's [GeoClaw site](http://www.geoclaw.org). 

#### D-Claw

D-Claw is a generalization of GeoClaw for solving two-phase flows (granular-fluid mixtures), including landslides, debris flows, and lahars. D-Claw can also be used for simulating hybrid problems that involve the interaction of granular-fluid flows with bodies of water (*eg.*, landslide-generated tsunamis, dam breach floods, fluid or solid entrainment by inundating flows).
